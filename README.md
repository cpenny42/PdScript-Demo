# PdScript-Demo
A demo of the PdScript functionality in dynamicpd.pd - part of Pd-for-LibPd

It's a simple demo of the subtractive_synth.pd patch found in pd-for-libpd where the objects are created & connected dynamically in SynthViewController.swift instead of relying on a main patch opened by PdBase.
